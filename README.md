# firebreak

Someday this might grow up to be an easy-to-use personal firewall with a 
traffic monitor. Basically a new version of Firestarter that supports IPv6.

As of now it's a simple network traffic monitor that uses a raw socket to
monitor tcp and udp traffic.  The Rescan button is a placeholder and doesn't
do anything at the moment

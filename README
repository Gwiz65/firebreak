firebreak

Someday this might grow up to be an easy-to-use personal firewall with a 
traffic monitor. Basically a new version of Firestarter that supports IPv6.

As of now it's a simple network traffic monitor that uses a raw socket to
monitor tcp and udp traffic.  The Rescan button is a placeholder and doesn't
do anything at the moment



 Installation
==============
Extract source archive to a directory and 'cd' to that directory and type:
	'autoreconf -i --force'
	'./configure'
	'make'

As root type:
	'make install'

To uninstall, as root type:
	'make uninstall'

Run (as regular user) by typing: 'firebreak'
